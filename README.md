# Ask the Angel
---
Ask the Angel is a silly bot I made for fun. You can ask it questions with `/ask`
and it will respond with a random option from a choice given to the player from Deltarune.
## Setup
(Note: this project has only been tested on Linux. It should probably work on others though)
### Requirements
- Rust build tools
- A Discord application
- A computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS. Probably.

1. Create a text file named `pwd` containing your bot token in the following directory corresponding to your operating system:

    * Windows: `%appdata%\ata`
    * Linux: `~/.local/share/ata`
    * MacOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/ata` 
2. Open the project folder in a terminal and type `cargo run`
